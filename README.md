- ⚡ Fun fact: The character of Yoda, the wise and powerful Jedi Master in Star Wars,
-       was initially going to be played by a monkey carrying a cane and wearing a mask.
-       However, this idea was eventually scrapped in favor of the puppet version of Yoda,
-       which was masterfully operated and voiced by Frank Oz.
